<!-- Problem text-->
<div class="Problem2">
<p>Although there are multiple benefits to having good time management, many students fail to realize the responsibilities it takes to start managing your time and to keep it. This lack of awareness that these students don’t realize can lead to some issues such as procrastination leading to doing your tasks when it might be too late. Therefore it’s an important need to develop an educational website that can inform these students about the responsibilities of time management.
