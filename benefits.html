<div class="Solution2">
<p> Starting to manage your time can be hard as it takes prioritisation and the ability to not get distracted by the distractions around you, however there are easier ways to start managing your time than just saying you're gonna start it and never end up in doing it. One example of a way to start managing your time is to create a plan or schedule to help you remember and decide when to do your work and when you can have free time. Planning things can help you remember and make sure you do your tasks that you have to do so you can get them done effectively and on time. Another way to start managing your time is to start things off slowly. Starting things off slowly can help with stress and focus exhaustion because you slowly get used to it which helps to build it into something you do in your daily life in which you can start increasing the amount of time you put into your tasks. Breaks are also important, by allowing your brain to recharge it can help you improve your focus and productivity on your task it can also help your memory.
